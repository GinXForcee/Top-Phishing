# Top-Level-Phishing üî• Alternative to Evilginx Pro.
Welcome to GinXForce - The Modified Version of Evilginx + Custom Botguard üëÄ, Bypassing Phishing Detections on The Fly For Sites like Gmail, Yahoo, Aol, Office & Instagram üõ°Ô∏è With EvilPuppet Which Opens a Background Browser Modifying Post Requests.

**Evilginx** is a man-in-the-middle attack framework used for phishing login credentials along with session cookies, which in turn allows to bypass 2-factor authentication protection. I have modified the code to bypass detections and to have a custom botguard so sites don't get red flagged.

This tool is a successor to [Evilginx](https://github.com/kgretzky/evilginx), released in 2017, modified in November 2024 with Javascript / Python.
